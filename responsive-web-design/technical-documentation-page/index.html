            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content.
            CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer
            questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content
            display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I
            decorate my webpage with background images and colors?
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="what_is_css?">

          <p>
            Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
            language either.
            <strong>CSS is a style sheet language.</strong>
            CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example,
            this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
          </p>
          <pre><code
>p {
  color: red;
}
</code></pre>

          <p>
            Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS
            (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory
            named styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to
            your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the
            appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project,
            pause here to read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head
              (between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; tags):

              <pre><code
>  &lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              Save index.html and load it in your browser. You should see
              something like this:
            </li>

            <li>
              If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is
              working.

              <img
                class="ui centered big image"
                src="website-screenshot-styled.png"
                alt=""
              />
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="anatomy_of_a_css_ruleset">
          <header id="anatomy_of_a_css_ruleset">
            <h1>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how
            it works:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="ui centered big image"
              src="css-declaration-small.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often
            referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
          </p>
          <h2>Selector</h2>
          <p>
            This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It
            defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, elements). To
            style a different element, change the selector.
          </p>
          <h2>Declaration</h2>
          <p>
            This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the
            element's properties you want to style.
          </p>
          <h2>Properties</h2>
          <p>
            hese are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this
            example, color is a property of the
          </p>
          <p>
            elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in
            the rule.
          </p>
          <h2>Property value</h2>
          <p>
            To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property
            value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given
            property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to
            red.)
          </p>
          <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly
              braces.({})
            </li>
            <li>
              Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the
              property from its value or values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each
              declaration from the next one.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them
            separated by semicolons, like this:
          </p>

          <pre><code
>p {
  color: red; 
  width: 500px; 
  border: 1px solid black; 
}
</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="selecting_multiple_elements">
          <header id="selecting_multiple_elements">
            <h1>Selecting multiple elements</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to
            all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:
          </p>
          <pre><code
>p, li, h1 {
  color: red;
}
</code></pre>

          <p>There are many different types of selectors as well.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="fonts_and_text">
          <header id="fonts_and_text"><h1>Fonts and text</h1></header>
          <p>
            Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the
            appearance of the example by adding more rules and information to
            the style.css file.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved
              from What will your website look like?. Add the &lt;link&gt;
              element somewhere inside your index.html's head (anywhere between
              the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;head&gt; tags). It looks something like
              this:

              <pre><code
>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet" &gt;
</code></pre>

              This code links your page to a style sheet that loads the Open
              Sans font family with your webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It
              was a good test, but let's not continue with lots of red text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the font-family
              assignment with your font-family selection from What will your
              website look like?. The property font-family refers to the font(s)
              you want to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and
              font size for the whole page. Since &lt;html&gt; is the parent
              element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same
              font-size and font-family.

              <pre><code
>html {
  font-size: 10px; /* px means "pixels": the base font size is now 10 pixels high */
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; /* this should be the rest of the output you got from Google fonts */
}
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside
              the HTML body (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and &lt;p&gt;). We'll also
              center the heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset
              (below) with settings for line height and letter spacing to make
              body content more readable.

              <pre><code
>h1 {
  font-size: 60px;
  text-align: center;
}
p, li {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 2;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
}
</code></pre>

              Adjust the px values as you like.Your work-in-progress should look
              similar to this:

              <img
                class="ui centered big image"
                src="website-screenshot-font-small.png"
                alt=""
              />
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="css:_all_about_boxes">
          <header id="css:_all_about_boxes">
            <h1>CSS: all about boxes</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about
            boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML
            elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of
            other boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up
            space on your page has properties like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is
              the space around the paragraph text.
            </li>
            <li>border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
            <li>margin, the space around the outside of the border.</li>
          </ul>
          <img class="ui centered big image" src="box-model.png" alt="" />
          <p>In this section we also use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>width (of an element)</li>
            <li>
              background-color, the color behind an element's content and
              padding.
            </li>
            <li>color, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
            <li>
              text-shadow sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.
            </li>
            <li>
              display sets the display mode of an element. (keep reading to
              learn more)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <p>
          To continue, let's add more CSS. Keep adding these new rules at the
          bottom of style.css. Experiment with changing values to see what
          happens.
        </p>

        <section>
          <header id="changing-the-page-color">
            <h2>Changing the page color</h2>
          </header>
          <pre><code
>html { 
  background-color: #00539F;
}
</code></pre>

          <p>
            This rule sets a background color for the entire page. Change the
            color code to the color you chose in What will my website look
            like?.
          </p>
          <header id="styling-the-body"><h2>Stying the body</h2></header>
          <pre><code
>body {
  width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: #FF9500;
  padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; 
  border: 5px solid black;
}
</code></pre>

          <p>
            There are several declarations for the &lt;body&gt; element. Let's
            go through these line-by-line:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              width: 600px; This forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.
            </li>
            <li>
              margin: 0 auto; When you set two values on a property like margin
              or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom
              side (setting it to 0 in this case); the second value affects the
              left and right side. (Here, auto is a special value that divides
              the available horizontal space evenly between left and right). You
              can also use one, two, three, or four values, as documented in
              Margin Syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
              background-color: #FF9500; This sets the element's background
              color. This project uses a reddish orange for the body background
              color, as opposed to dark blue for the &lt;html&gt; element. (Feel
              free to experiment.)
            </li>
            <li>
              padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; This sets four values for padding. The
              goal is to put some space around the content. In this example,
              there is no padding on the top of the body, and 20 pixels on the
              right, bottom and left. The values set top, right, bottom, left,
              in that order. As with margin, you can use one, two, three, or
              four values, as documented in Padding Syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
              border: 5px solid black; This sets values for the width, style and
              color of the border. In this case, it's a five-pixel- wide, solid
              black border, on all sides of the body.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <header id="positioning_and_styling_the_main_page_title">
            <h2>Positioning and styling the main page title</h2>
          </header>
          <pre><code
>h1 {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px 0;
  color: #00539F;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px black;
}
</code></pre>

          <p>
            You may have noticed there's a horrible gap at the top of the body.
            That happens because browsers apply default styling to the
            &lt;h1&gt; element (among others). That might seem like a bad idea,
            but the intent is to provide basic readability for unstyled pages.
            To eliminate the gap, we overwrite the browser's default styling
            with the setting margin: 0;
          </p>
          <p>Next, we set the heading's top and bottom padding to 20 pixels.</p>
          <p>
            Following that, we set the heading text to be the same color as the
            HTML background color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, text-shadow applies a shadow to the text content of the
            element. Its four values are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first pixel value sets the horizontal offset of the shadow
              from the text: how far it moves across.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second pixel value sets the vertical offset of the shadow from
              the text: how far it moves down.
            </li>
            <li>
              The third pixel value sets the blur radius of the shadow. A larger
              value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.
            </li>
            <li>The fourth value sets the base color of the shadow.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Try experimenting with different values to see how it changes the
            appearance.
          </p>

</code></pre>
          <p>
            Next, we center the image to make it look better. We could use the
            margin: 0 auto trick again as we did for the body. But there are
            differences that require an additional setting to make the CSS work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The &lt;body&gt; is a block element, meaning it takes up space on
            the page. The margin applied to a block element will be respected by
            other elements on the page. In contrast, images are inline elements,
            for the auto margin trick to work on this image, we must give it
            block-level behavior using display: block;.
